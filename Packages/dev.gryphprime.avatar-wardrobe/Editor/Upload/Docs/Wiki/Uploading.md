# Uploading

## Per-preset buttons

The compact card header keeps **Select**, **Ping**, **Upload**, batch inclusion, and the platform summary visible. Expand the card to edit the Blueprint ID and platform targets or access VRAM, thumbnail, blendshape, item, and FaceEmo tools.

- **Select** — activates a single preset in the scene (sets tags, Blueprint ID, blendshapes, items, FaceEmo) **without** uploading. Great for previewing what would be uploaded.
- **Upload** — activates + uploads that single preset (only shown once it has a Blueprint ID).
- **⚡ Express / ⚙ Advanced** — shown when the preset has no Blueprint ID yet. See [[New Preset Setup|New-Preset-Setup]].

## Upload All (guided batch)

Tick **Include in batch** on the presets you want, then press **Upload All**. Use the **All / None** buttons at the top of the preset list to toggle every preset at once.

If some selected presets aren't set up yet (no Blueprint ID), the tool first walks you through them:

1. A prompt asks: **Express all** / **Ask me per preset** / **Cancel**.
2. If you chose per preset, each unconfigured preset asks: **Express setup** / **Skip** / **Configure…** (a popup with name, description, content tags and thumbnail).
3. Each set-up preset is created & uploaded on the **current platform**.

Then the already-configured presets run through the normal platform-grouped batch.

> New presets are uploaded on the current platform during setup. To also build them for other platforms (Android/iOS), run **Upload All** again — they now have IDs and will be included.

The status line shows e.g. `12 selected — 9 ready, 3 need setup`.

## Cross-platform batching

For each preset you can tick **Win / And / iOS**. The batch groups presets by platform and switches the Unity build target as few times as possible (Windows → Android → iOS), starting with whatever platform you're already on.

Progress is shown with a platform-tinted bar (Blue = Windows, Green = Android, Silver = iOS) and per-step sub-progress.

## Domain Reload Survival

Switching the Unity build target forces a **domain reload** (scripts recompile, running code is wiped). The batch queue is stored in `SessionState`, so it **pauses and automatically resumes** after each platform switch / recompile. It also waits for the VRChat SDK builder to re-initialise and for you to be logged in before resuming.

## Safety & convenience

- **Ownership confirmation** is asked once up front (not per preset mid-batch).
- The SDK's **copyright/ownership dialog** for new-avatar uploads is auto-confirmed (best-effort; you still confirm once in the tool).
- **Login & platform checks** run before building to avoid mid-batch failures.
- A **sound** plays when the whole queue is done (toggle: "🔔 Sound when done").
- **Validation errors** on one preset are logged and skipped; the summary at the end lists what was skipped so you can fix and re-upload those.
- Blendshape values are **restored** to their original state after the batch.
- If an preset disappears after the queue is created, it is recorded as failed rather than counted as a successful upload.
- Queue and resume state are cleaned up after completion or cancellation.
